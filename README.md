# BINF_Group_Project

This repository includes scripts and outlines of data analysis for my final project in Bioinformatics at Augustana University.

My portion of the project is looking at the expression of APOE gene variants by tissue types in the body. 

# Data
My data was obtained from https://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/APOE under the heading "Significant Single-Tissue eQTLs for APOE (ENSG00000130203.10) in all tissues"
This data is significant expression data including the variant ID, the SNP ID, the Phenotype ID(s), the Intron ID, the P-Value, NES values, and Tissue Sample. 

# Scripts
Scripts included in this repository are draft scripts for analyzing this data in R using R Studio.
The current script includes data analysis of Box Plot and PCA analysis; however, after further inspection of the data set, a network is the better representation of APOE variant expression and will be completed next.
